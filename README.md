## Pipes and Filters implemented in Python

This is a very basic implementation of the Pipes and Filters pattern.
It is inspired by two articles called 'Messaging as a programming model' (Part 1 and 2) written by Steve Bate (Twitter: [@Steve_Bate](https://twitter.com/Steve_Bate)).

- Messaging as a programming model Part 1 http://eventuallyconsistent.net/2013/08/12/messaging-as-a-programming-model-part-1/
- Messaging as a programming model Part 2 http://eventuallyconsistent.net/2013/08/14/messaging-as-a-programming-model-part-2/

I'm pretty new to Python so this implementation migth have some flaws or could be done more easily, elegant or what not.
Oh.. and this is the first time I've set up a `setup.py` and I'm not really sure if I've done it the right way.
So if you see anything you want to improve, leave a message or send a pull request.
I'd be happy to talk about improvements :)

Also, for the future it would be really nice to introduced some `unittests` and a logging system. I don't know when I'm going to introduce such things.
